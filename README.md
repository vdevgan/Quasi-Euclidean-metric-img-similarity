# Quasi-Euclidean-metric-img-similarity
## Implementing Quasi Euclidean Distance metric to compute similarity between two images.
## Quasi euclidian formula was implemented to form a quasi euclidian distance metric.

###  In new_Code:
#### Better performance significantly than last code.
#### This time compared with, SSIM.
#### In some kind of cases, performed better than SSIM.


### In old_Code:
#### manhattan distance metric was also tried and compared.
#### In some cases, quasi euclidian metric performed better and in some cases worse.
#### images were converted into 2D form and grayscaled before being worked on.

#### The formula for quasi euclidian metric is taken from: http://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwdist.html  .
