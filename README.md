# Quasi-Euclidean-metric-img-similarity
#### Implementing Quasi Euclidean Distance metric to compute similarity between two images.
#### Quasi euclidian formula was implemented to form a quasi euclidian distance metric.
#### manhattan distance metric was also tried and compared.
#### In some cases, quasi euclidian metric performed better and in some cases worse.
#### A presentation of the same has been uploaded.
#### The formula for quasi euclidian is taken from: http://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/bwdist.html  .
